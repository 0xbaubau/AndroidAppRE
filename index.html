# Introduction
Welcome to Android App Reverse Engineering 101! This workshop's goal is to give you the foundations to begin reverse engineering Android applications. While this workshop won't teach you the details of Android app development, Android malware analysis, Android vulnerability hunting, etc., I hope to give you all the necessary foundations through this workshop such that you can apply your new Android reversing skills to doing those things.

This workshop will be wholly based on reverse engineering through static analysis, or analyzing and understanding an application by examining its code. I won't be covering dynamic analysis where an analyst runs an application and understands the application by executing it, debugging it, etc. Why? Static analysis tends to be a less approachable skill for people to pick up on their own, so I want to help you do it! (And I really love static analysis)

# Android Application Fundamentals
One of my biggest suggestions for folks looking to reverse engineer things, whatever they may be, is to try and build what you want to reverse. In the case of Android, you're lucky because there are so many free resources available to build your first application. If you've never built an Android application before, I suggest you start there. Pick any of the available tutorials and videos that spark your interest and get to building. When you understand *how* a developer builds something, it makes it much easier to understand how to reverse engineer it. 

These are the topics I expect you to learn from building your Android app:
* APK File Format
    * Manifest
	* classes.dex
* Android App Components
    * Activities
	* Services
	* Receivers
	* Providers
